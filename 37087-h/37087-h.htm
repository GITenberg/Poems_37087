Here in a quiet and dusty room they lie,<BR>
Faded as crumbled stone or shifting sand,<BR>
Forlorn as ashes, shrivelled, scentless, dry&mdash;<BR>
Meadows and gardens running through my hand.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Dead that shall quicken at the call of Spring,<BR>
Sleepers to stir beneath June's magic kiss,<BR>
Though birds pass over, unremembering,<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
In this brown husk a dale of hawthorn dreams<BR>
A cedar in this narrow cell is thrust<BR>
That will drink deeply of a century's streams,<BR>
These lilies shall make summer on my dust.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Here in their safe and simple house of death,<BR>
Sealed in their shells a million roses leap;<BR>
Here I can blow a garden with my breath,<BR>
And in my hand a forest lies asleep.<BR>

THE NEW ASPASIA.<BR>
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
If I have given myself to you and you,<BR>
And if these pale hands are not virginal,<BR>
Nor these bright lips beneath your own lips true,<BR>
What matters it?  I do not stand nor fall<BR>
By your old foolish judgments of desire:<BR>
If this were Helen's way it is not mine;<BR>
I bring you beauty, but no Troys to fire:<BR>
The cup I hold brims not with Borgia's wine.<BR>
You, so soon snared of sudden brows and breasts,<BR>
Lightly you think upon these lips, this hair.<BR>
My thoughts are kinder: you are pity's guests:<BR>
Compassion's bed you share.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
It was not lust delivered me to you;<BR>
I gave my wondering mouth for pity's sake,<BR>
For your strange, sighing lips I did but break<BR>
Many times this bread, and poured this wine anew.<BR>
My body's woven sweetness and kindling hair<BR>
Were given for heal of hurts unknown of me,<BR>
For something I could slake but could not share.<BR>
Sudden and rough and cruel I let you be,<BR>
I gave my body for what the world calls sin,<BR>
Even as for your souls the Nazarene<BR>
Gave once.  Long years in pity I and He<BR>
Have served you&mdash;Jesus and the Magdalen.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
As on the river in the fading light<BR>
A rust-red sail across the evening creeps,<BR>
Torching the gloom, and slowly sinks from sight,<BR>
The blood may rise to some old face at night,<BR>
Remembering old sins before it sleeps.<BR>
So might you hence recall me, were I true<BR>
To your sad violence.  Were I not free<BR>
So me you might remember now; but you<BR>
Were no more loved by me<BR>
Than clouds at sunset, or the wild bird going<BR>
About his pleasure on the apple tree,<BR>
Or wide-blown roses swelling to the bee;<BR>
No sweeter than flowers suddenly found growing<BR>
In frost-bound dells, or, on the bare, high hills,<BR>
The gold, unlaced, dew-drunken daffodils<BR>
Shouting the dawn, or the brown river flowing<BR>
Down quietly to the sea;<BR>
Or day in twilight's hair bound safe and dim,<BR>
Stirless in lavender, or the wind blowing,<BR>
Tumbling the poppy's turban after him.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
I knew you as I knew these happy things,<BR>
Passing, unwept, on wide and tranquil wings<BR>
To their own place in nature; below, above<BR>
Transient passion with its stains and stings.<BR>
For this strange pity that you knew not of<BR>
Was neither lust nor love.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Do not repent, nor pity, nor regret.<BR>
I do not seek your pardon, nor give you mine.<BR>
Pass by, be silent, drop no tears, forget.<BR>
Return not, make no sign<BR>
When I am dead, nor turn your lips away<BR>
From Phryne's silver limbs and Faustine's kiss.<BR>
I need no pity.  No word of pity say.<BR>
I have given a new sweet name and crown to this<BR>
That served men's lust and was Aspasia.<BR>

A SONG FOR OLD LOVE.<BR>
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
There shall be a song for both of us that day<BR>
Though fools say you have long outlived your songs,<BR>
And when, perhaps, because your hair is grey,<BR>
You go unsung, to whom all praise belongs,<BR>
And no men kiss your hands&mdash;your fragile hands<BR>
Folded like empty shells on sea-spurned sands.<BR>
And you that were dawn whereat men shouted once<BR>
Are sunset now, with but one worshipper,<BR>
Then to your twilight heart this song shall be<BR>
Sweeter than those that did your youth announce<BR>
For your brave beautiful spirit is lovelier<BR>
Than once your lovely body was to me.<BR>
Your folded hands and your shut eyelids stir<BR>
A passion that Time has crowned with sanctity.<BR>
Young fools shall wonder why, your youth being over,<BR>
You are so sung still, but your heart will know<BR>
That he who loved your soul was your true lover<BR>
And the last song alone was worthy you.<BR>

From this green, bright and tossing world to part?"<BR>
No word of "Do they miss her? do they grieve?"<BR>
Only this wolf-thought for the gold she had...<BR>

MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.<BR>
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
I am growing old: I have kept youth too long,<BR>
But I dare not let them know it now.<BR>
I have done the heart of youth a grievous wrong,<BR>
Danced it to dust and drugged it with the rose,<BR>
Forced its reluctant lips to one more vow.<BR>
I have denied the lawful grey,<BR>
So kind, so wise, to settle in my hair;<BR>
I belong no more to April, but September has not taught me her repose.<BR>
I wish I had let myself grow old in the quiet way<BR>
That is so gracious....  I wish I did not care.<BR>
My faded mouth will never flower again,<BR>
Under the paint the wrinkles fret my eyes,<BR>
My hair is dull beneath its henna stain,<BR>
I have come to the last ramparts of disguise.<BR>
And now the day draws on of my defeat.<BR>
I shall not meet<BR>
The swift, male glance across the crowded room,<BR>
Where the chance contact of limbs in passing has<BR>
Its answer in some future fierce embrace.<BR>
I shall sit there in the corners looking on<BR>
With the older women, withered and overblown,<BR>
Who have grown old more graciously than I,<BR>
In a sort of safe and comfortable tomb<BR>
Knitting myself into Eternity.<BR>
And men will talk to me because they are kind,<BR>
Or as cunning or as courtesy demands;<BR>
There will be no hidden question in their eyes<BR>
And no subtle implication in their hands.<BR>
And I shall be so grateful who have been<BR>
So gracious, and so tyrannous, moving between<BR>
Denial and surrender.  To-morrow I shall find<BR>
How women live who have no lovers and no answer for life's<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;grey monotonies.<BR>
Upon my table will be no more flowers,<BR>
They will bring me no more flowers till I am dead;<BR>
There will be no violent, sweet, exciting hours,<BR>
No wild things done or said.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Yet sometimes I'm so tired of it all&mdash;<BR>
This everlasting battle with the flesh,<BR>
This pitiful slavery to the body's thrall&mdash;<BR>
And then I do not want to lure or charm,<BR>
I want to wear<BR>
Soft, easy things, be comfortable and warm;<BR>
I want to drowse at leisure in my chair.<BR>
I do not want to wear a veil with heavy mesh,<BR>
Or sit in shaded rooms afraid to face the light;<BR>
I do not want to go out every night,<BR>
And be bright and vivid and intense,<BR>
Nor be on the alert and the defence<BR>
With other women, fierce and afraid as I,<BR>
Drawing a knife unseen as each goes by.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
I am so tired of men and making love,<BR>
For every one's the same.<BR>
There's nothing new in love beneath the sun;<BR>
All love can say or do has long been said and done:<BR>
I have eaten the fruit of knowledge long enough,<BR>
Been over-kissed, over-praised and over-won.<BR>
Why should I try to play still the old, foolish game?<BR>
Because I have played the rose's part too long.<BR>
Who plays the rose must pay the rose's price,<BR>
And be a rose or nothing till it dies.<BR>
And even then sometimes the blood will answer fierce and strong<BR>
To the old hunger, to the old dance, old tune;<BR>
I shall feel cruel and passionate and mad<BR>
Though I have lost the look of June.<BR>
The fever of the past will burn my hands<BR>
As men who live long in intemperate lands<BR>
Feel the old ague wring them, far removed<BR>
From the old dreadful glitter of seas and sands.<BR>
The rose dies hard in women who have had<BR>
Lovers all their lives, and have been much loved.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
I am afraid to grow old now even if I would.<BR>
I have fought too well, too long, and what was once<BR>
A foolish trick to make the rose more strangely gay<BR>
Is now a close-locked, mortal conflict of brain and blood&mdash;<BR>
A feud too old to settle or renounce.<BR>
I shall grow too tired to struggle, and the fight will end,<BR>
And they will enter in at last&mdash;<BR>
Nature and Time, long thwarted of their prey,<BR>
Those old grey two, more cruel for the lips that said them "Nay,"<BR>
For the bitterest foe is he who in the past<BR>
Has been repulsed when he would fain be friend.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
I am sorry for women who are growing old,<BR>
I do not blame them holding youth with shameful hold,<BR>
Or doing desperate things to lips and eyes.<BR>
They have so pitifully short a flowering time,<BR>
So suddenly sweet a story so soon told.<BR>
They only strive to keep what men have taught them most to prize&mdash;<BR>
Men who have longer, fuller lives to live,<BR>
Who are not stopped and broken in their prime,<BR>
With their faces still to summer, Men do not know<BR>
What Age says to a woman.  They would not wait<BR>
To feel slip from their hands without a throe,<BR>
Without a struggle, futile and desperate,<BR>
All that has given them wealth and love and power<BR>
Doomed, without hope or rumour of reprieve.<BR>
They would not smile into the eyes of that advancing hour<BR>
Who had bent all summer to their bow, and had flung<BR>
The widest rose and kissed the keenest mouth<BR>
And slept in the lordliest bed when they were young.<BR>
That bitter twilight which sun-worshipping Youth<BR>
Flies headlong keeps Age loitering on the hill,<BR>
Uneager to fold such greyness to his breast,<BR>
Knowing that none will thwart him of his will,<BR>
None be before him on that quest.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
I am growing old.<BR>
I was not always kind when I was young<BR>
To women who were old, for Youth is blind&mdash;<BR>
A small, green, bitter thing beneath its fragrant rind,<BR>
And fanged against the old with boisterous tongue&mdash;<BR>
Those whose poor morning heads are touched with rime,<BR>
Walking before their misery like kings.<BR>
I did not think that I should feel such stings,<BR>
Nor flinch beneath such arrows.  But now I know.<BR>
One day I shall be stupid and rather slow,<BR>
And easily cowed and troubled in my mind,<BR>
And tremulous, vaguely frightened, feeble and cold.<BR>
I am growing old....  My God! how old, how old! ...<BR>
I dare not tell them, but one day they will know...<BR>
I hope they will be kind.<BR>

Heaves with crushed lips and glowing sides<BR>
Against the huge and drowsy sun.<BR>
Beneath them turn the glittering tides<BR>
Where dizzy waters reel with gold,<BR>
And strange, rich trophies sink and rise<BR>
From decks of sunken argosies.<BR>
With shining arms they cleave the cold<BR>
Far reaches of the sea, and beat<BR>
The hissing foam with flash of feet<BR>
Into bright fangs, while breathlessly<BR>
Curls over them the amorous sea.<BR>

Naked they laugh and revel there.<BR>
One shakes the sea-drops from his hair,<BR>

One floats like sea-wrack in the sun.<BR>
The gods of Youth, the lords of Love,<BR>
Greeks of eternal Thessaly,<BR>
Mocking the powers they know not of,<BR>
Naked and unembraced and free!<BR>

Oh, Cythera, the trembling blood<BR>
Upon one petal's paling mouth<BR>
Before thee and this noon must rise<BR>
While thou remember Adon's eyes!<BR>
One mournful and complaining shade<BR>
Beyond Avernus bows his head,<BR>
Dreaming of one beloved youth<BR>
Borne from him, lost and dazed and dead,<BR>

Men wondered why I loved you, and none guessed<BR>
How sweet your slow, divine stupidity,<BR>
Your look of earth, your sense of drowsy rest,<BR>

These salt hands holding sweetness, the leader led,<BR>

Sea land-locked, brine and honey in one bed,<BR>
And England's man your servant and your fool!<BR>
My banqueting eyes foreswore my waiting ships;<BR>
I was a silly landsman at your lips.<BR>

I stood forlorn and pale,<BR>
Pressed by the cold sand, pinched by the thin grass,<BR>
Last of my race and frail<BR>
Who reigned in beauty once when beauty was,<BR>
Before the rich earth beckoned to the sea,<BR>
Took his salt lips to taste,<BR>
And spread this gradual waste&mdash;<BR>
This ruin of flower, this doom of grass and tree.<BR>
Each Spring could scarcely lift<BR>
My brows from the sand drift<BR>
To fill my lips with April as she went,<BR>
Or force my weariness<BR>
To its sad, summer dress:<BR>
On the harsh beach I heard the grey sea rise,<BR>
The ragged grass made ceaseless, dim lament,<BR>
And day and night scarce changed the mournful skies.<BR>

Foot on the sand, a shadow on the sea!<BR>
A face leaned over me.<BR>

From my frail feet fell the last grains of sand.<BR>
Then haste and darkness stooped and made me theirs;<BR>
Deep handed me to deep;...<BR>

As a sigh from lips at last made friends with sleep.<BR>

</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
Unaware of its terror,<BR>
And but half aware<BR>
Of the world's beauty near her&mdash;<BR>
Of sunlight on the stones,<BR>
And trembling birds in the square,<BR>
Lightly went Madala&mdash;<BR>
A rose blown suddenly<BR>
From Spring's gay mouth; part of the Spring was she.<BR>
Warmed to her delicate bones,<BR>
Cool in its linen her skin,<BR>
Her hair up-combed and curled,<BR>
Lightly she flowered on the sin<BR>
And pain of the Spring-struck world.<BR>
Down the street went crazy men,<BR>
The winter misery of their blood<BR>
Budding in new pain<BR>
While beggars whined beside her,<BR>
While the streets' daughters eyed her,&mdash;<BR>
Poor flowers that kept midsummer<BR>
With desperate bloom, and thrust<BR>
Stale rose at each newcomer,<BR>
And crime and hunger and lust<BR>
Raged in the noisy dust.<BR>
Lightly went Madala,<BR>
Unshaken still of that spell,<BR>
Coral beads and jade to buy,<BR>
While her thoughts roamed easily&mdash;<BR>
Thoughts like bees in lavender,&mdash;<BR>
Thoughts gay and fragile as a robin's shell.<BR>
Till suddenly she had come<BR>
To grim age-stubborned wall<BR>
Behind whose mask of bars<BR>
Starts up in shame the Foundlings' Hospital.*<BR>
At the gates to watch her pass<BR>
A caged thing eyed her dumb,<BR>
Most mercifully unaware<BR>
Of its own hurt, but Madala<BR>
Stopped short of Spring that day.<BR>
The air grew pinched and wan,<BR>
A hand came over the sun,<BR>
Birds huddled, stones went grey.<BR>
Her lace and linen white<BR>
Seemed but her body's sin,<BR>
Her flesh unscarred and bright<BR>
Burnt like a leper's skin.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Her mouth was stale with bread<BR>
Flung her by strangers, she was fed,<BR>
Housed, fathered by the State, and she had grown<BR>
A thing belonging to, and loved by, none.<BR>
Though the shut mouth said no word,<BR>
From the caged thing she heard,<BR>
"Who has wronged me, that this Spring<BR>
"Gives me nothing and you everything,<BR>
"Who alike were made,<BR>
"Who beckon the same dreams?<BR>
"You buy coral and jade,<BR>
"I sew long hungry seams<BR>
"To pay for charity..."<BR>
Then Madala's heart, afraid,<BR>
Cried the first selfish cry:<BR>
"Is it my fault?  Can I<BR>
"Help what the world has done?<BR>
"Can the flower in the shade<BR>
"Blame the flower in the sun?"<BR>
Then quick the caged thing said,<BR>
As if to ask pardon that its words had made<BR>
Madala's spring so spoiled for her that day:<BR>
"But there's a way, a way!<BR>
"If flowers would share their Spring<BR>
"There'd be sunshine enough for all the flowers.<BR>
"Such sunshine you could bring,<BR>
"Such joy that swings and flies<BR>
"With posies your hours through,<BR>
"So just beyond my hours.<BR>
"If I could walk with you&mdash;<BR>
"Not in pitiful two by two<BR>
"Flayed by free children's eyes,<BR>
"Your sister for an hour to be,<BR>
"It would double joy and woo<BR>
"Spring back to you, and more than Spring to me."<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Then something quaked in Madala,<BR>
Quaked with magic, quaked with awe.<BR>
Love-quickening, she became a part<BR>
Of this caged thing, she was aware<BR>
Of strange lips tugging at her heart.<BR>
So clear the way was!  Tenderer<BR>
Grew her eyes, and as they grew,<BR>
Back to the flowers rushed the dew,<BR>
The earth filled out with the sun,<BR>
The cold birds in the square<BR>
Unbundled and preened upon<BR>
Their twigs in the softening air;<BR>
The cold wind dwindled and dropped,<BR>
And love and the world were one.<BR>
Nearer drew Madala,<BR>
At the dumb thing she smiled,<BR>
And Spring that a child had stopped<BR>
Came back from the eyes of a child.<BR>

This Poem, Dedicated to His Mother.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
To twilight heads comes Death as comes a friend,<BR>
As with the gentle fading of the year<BR>
Fades rose, folds leaf, falls fruit, and to their end<BR>
Unquestioning draw near,<BR>
Their flowering over, and their fruiting done,<BR>
Fulfilled and finished and going down with the sun.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
But for June's heart there is no comforting<BR>
When her full-throated rose<BR>
Still quick with buds, still thrilling to the air,<BR>
By some stray wind is tossed,<BR>
Her swelling grain that goes<BR>
Heavy to harvesting<BR>
In a black gale is lost,<BR>
And her round grape that purpled to the wine<BR>
Is pinched by some chance frost.<BR>
Ah, then cry out for that lost, lovely rose,<BR>
For the stricken wheat, and for the finished vine!<BR>
Such were you who sleep now, who have foregone<BR>
So many of Life's rich secrets almost learned;<BR>
Winning so much, so much as yet unwon,<BR>
Yet to be dared, to discover, to reveal.<BR>
Quick still with ardour, hand still at the wheel<BR>
On wide and unsailed seas, eyes turning still<BR>
Towards the morning, while the keen brain burned<BR>
To the imperative will.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Upon your summer Death seems to set his heel,<BR>
Writes on the page "No more,"<BR>
And brings the sign of sunset, shuts the door<BR>
And the house is dark and the tired mourners sleep.<BR>
Yet says he too, "Though quiet at last you lie,<BR>
"And have done with laughter and strife and joy and care,<BR>
"You have honour with your peace; and still you keep<BR>
"Fullness of life and of felicity.<BR>
"You have seen the Grail.  What need you of grey hair?<BR>
"There are those who daily die,<BR>
"Who have long out lived their welcome in the world,<BR>
"Who are old and sad and tired and fain to cease<BR>
"From the crowded earth, and the hours in tumult whirled,<BR>
"Urgent and vain.  You are not such as these<BR>
"Who have striven for laurels, and never knew the shade<BR>
"Upon their brows, who would persuade the rose,<BR>
"And never have come near it; till the head<BR>
"Bows and the heart breaks, and the spirit knows<BR>
"Only its failure, dim and featureless,&mdash;<BR>
"Its weariness of all things dreamed and done,<BR>
"When love and grief alike seem emptiness<BR>
"And fame and man's unrecognition one."<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
The full tide took you.  You went out with the sun,<BR>
Not in the cringing ebb, not in the grey<BR>
And tremulous twilight, when each lonely one<BR>
To its last loneliness must creep away.<BR>
Your genius has won its rich repose,<BR>
Full laurelled, wearing still the unfaded rose.<BR>
And as those who bid good-bye at snowdrop time<BR>
Bear with them broken promises of Spring,<BR>
So you in triumph,&mdash;in the glory men had in you,<BR>
In Love's full worshipping,&mdash;<BR>
High summer thoughts, untouched of Winter's rime,<BR>
Went forth with honour, having fulfilled your Spring.<BR>
The hands that built you felt you flower from her prayer,<BR>
True to her vision true;<BR>
Fearless and fine, shaped from her fashioning;<BR>
Hands empty now, and yet not all unfilled,<BR>
Having built and fired the generous heart and brain,<BR>
Of the man you were; whose fervent spirit willed<BR>
You to the service and healing and help of men.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
These things are hers, not to be lost nor changed<BR>
With changes of death; for though the body die<BR>
The golden deed is stamped eternally<BR>
With the head of God.  The new and alien years<BR>
Leave it still bright, unaltered, unestranged.<BR>
Almost too proud, and too profound for tears<BR>
Is the high memory that the desolate heart<BR>
Shrines and is dumb, yet may for ever keep<BR>
Unforbidden, the imperishable part,<BR>
And what Love held, awake, he holds, asleep.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
The evening found us whom the day had fled,<BR>
Once more in bitter anger, you and I,<BR>
Over some small, some foolish, trivial thing<BR>
Our anger would not decently let die.<BR>
But dragged between us, shamed and shivering,<BR>
Until each other's taunts we scarcely heard,<BR>
Until we lost the sense of all we said,<BR>
And knew not who first spoke the fatal word.<BR>
It seemed that even every kiss we wrung<BR>
We killed at birth with shuddering and hate,<BR>
As if we feared a thing too passionate.<BR>
However close we clung<BR>
One hour, the next hour found us separate,<BR>
Estranged, and Love most bitter on our tongue.<BR>
To-night we quarrelled over one small head,<BR>
Our fruit of last year's maying, the white bud<BR>
Blown from our stormy kisses and the dead<BR>
First rapture of our wild, estranging blood.<BR>
You clutched him: there was panther in your eyes,<BR>
We breathed like beasts in thickets; on the wall<BR>
Our shadows swelled as in huge tyrannies,<BR>
The room grew dark with anger, yet through all<BR>
The shame and hurt and pity of it you were<BR>
Still strangely and imperishably dear,<BR>
As one who loves the wild day none the less<BR>
That turns to naught the lilac's miracle,<BR>
Breaking the unrecapturable spell<BR>
Of the first may-tree, magic and mystery<BR>
Utterly scattering of earth and sky.<BR>
Making even the rose's loveliness<BR>
A thing for pain to be remembered by.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
I said: "My son shall wear his father's sword."<BR>
You said: "Shall hands once blossoms at my breast<BR>
Be stained with blood?"  I answered with a word<BR>
More bitter, and your own, the bitterest,<BR>
Stung me to sullen anger, and I said:<BR>
"My son shall be no coward of his line<BR>
Because his mother choose"; you turned your head,<BR>
And your eyes grew implacable on mine.<BR>
And like a trodden snake you turned to meet<BR>
The foe with sudden hissing ... then you smiled<BR>
And broke our life in pieces at my feet,<BR>
"Your child?" you said.  "<I>Your</I> child?" ...<BR>

The shackled feet of centuries cannot keep<BR>
Pace yet with feet that have outstripped the world.<BR>
For the maimed even the riven way is steep.<BR>
I am so strange to greatness, I am hurled<BR>
Unsceptred to my glory!  I am now<BR>
Almost what you have called me, as things take<BR>
The colour of names men give them; as things grow<BR>
Fierce if dubbed fierce, and weak if branded weak,<BR>
And fools if given no name but foolishness.<BR>
I have been branded fool in life and art,&mdash;<BR>
Always a little lower, always the less,<BR>
Until the intolerable prompting has grown part<BR>
Of all I do; my labouring brain and heart<BR>
By that self-doubt are shadowed and undone.<BR>
Let me walk long beside you in the sun,<BR>
Race, wrestle with you, grow wise and swift and strong.<BR>
For I shall speak but foolish words at first<BR>
Who was hindered of wisdom since the world began.<BR>
I shall blunder and be so wayward who was nursed<BR>
On fear and folly by the laws of man.<BR>

Produced by Al Haines

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
